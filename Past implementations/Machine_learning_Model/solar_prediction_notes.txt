The solar forecasting model is showing excellent results! Let's analyze the output:

Model Performance:


RÂ² Score of 0.98 indicates the model explains 98% of the variance in solar production
RMSE of 14.54 and MAE of 10.96 suggest good prediction accuracy relative to the production values (which range from ~350-700)


Feature Importance:
Most influential features:


solar_radiation (53.2%) - by far the most important predictor
windspeed (43.6%) - surprisingly significant impact
temperature (2.8%) - minor but notable influence
Other features have minimal impact (<1%)


Training Progress:


The RMSE decreased steadily from 103.85 to 14.54
Model converged well, with diminishing improvements in later iterations


Visualization Analysis:


Actual vs Predicted plot shows strong linear correlation
Residual plot shows:

Fairly even distribution around zero
Some heteroscedasticity (variance increases with predicted values)
No clear systematic bias



Recommendations:

Feature Engineering:

Consider interaction terms between solar_radiation and windspeed
Could drop low-importance features (month_sin, month_cos, cloudcover)
Add polynomial features for solar_radiation


Model Improvements:

Try different XGBoost parameters (e.g., higher max_depth)
Consider ensemble with other models
Implement cross-validation for more robust evaluation


For Wind Data:

Need to investigate why WindProduction table is empty
Check NREL_wind_api_request.py for potential issues
Verify wind data collection process
